Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping
uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub.


I used Mocha and Chai to test my JokeApi and the code can be found here:

I tested asynchronous code in the first part of the TestExercises.pdf, and the project can be
