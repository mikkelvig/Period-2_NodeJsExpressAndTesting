Period 2 - Node.js, Express + JavaScript Backend Testing

Mikkel Vig

This is my hand-in for the 2. period MEAN JavaScript course. In this project,
i have one file for each question, with relevant code, and/or text, to answer the question.
Some of the code will be taken from a larger project, witch means that you wont be able
to actually run it from here.
A link to the project it is taken from, will be provided in the file.



The projects previously referred to are:

JokeApiExercises-Period2 - https://github.com/mikkelvig/JokeApiExercises-Period2
This is my solution to the questions found in ExpressExercises.pdf + part of the TestExercises.pdf
found on Fronter.

Week3Test - https://github.com/mikkelvig/Week3Test
This project includes an example we did in class + a solution to the first part of
the TestExercises.pdf.
