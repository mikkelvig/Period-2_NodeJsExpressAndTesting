For a long time JavaScript was used only for front-end, until Google's V8 engine came along.
This made JavaScript run much faster, and spawned the creation of things like NodeJs, witch
allows for server side JavaScript.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side Web
applications. Although Node.js is not a JavaScript framework, many of its basic modules are
written in JavaScript, and developers can write new modules in JavaScript.

The real magic behind Node is the event loop. The event loop is a single thread that performs
all I/O operations asynchronously. Traditionally, I/O operations either run synchronously
(blocking) or asynchronously by spawning off parallel threads to perform the work, consuming
a lot of memory. In contrast, when a Node application needs to perform an I/O operation,
it sends an asynchronous task to the event loop, along with a callback function, and then
continues to execute the rest of its program. When the async operation completes, the event
loop returns to the task to execute its callback.

Reading and writing to network connections, filesystem, or database execute very, very fast
in Node. Node allows you to build fast, scalable network applications capable of handling a
huge number of simultaneous connections.
